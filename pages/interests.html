            <h2>Personal interests and growth</h2>
            <p>
                These interests matter to me because they connect to how I work
                and learn. Each one has shaped my discipline, problem solving,
                and teamwork in some way.

                <h3>Soccer and leadership</h3>

                <img src="../images/soccer.jpg" alt="Playing soccer during a game for Calgary Foothils">

                <p>
                    I have played soccer for many years, with Calgary foothills, Calgary
                    Villains Majors and League 1 teams. And have been a captain
                    and MVP in school and club settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soccer has taught me discipline, communication, and how to
                    handle pressure. It also showed me how to lead by example
                    and support others even when things are not going well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to stay connected to soccer in the future, either
                    by playing, coaching, or supporting teams in some way.

                </div>

                <p>
                    I enjoy working with cars, especially when it involves diagnostics
                    and coding. I have used BMW tools such as INPA, TOOL32 and OB2 with integrated coding to
                    read data and adjust settings. I also have a strong hands on mechanical background to working on cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This pushes me to learn how different systems talk to each other
                    and how software affects real hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to connect this interest with my tech skills by
                    working in a role that combines IT and automotive systems.

                <h3>PC building and hardware</h3>

                <img src="../images/PcSetup.jpeg" alt="Custom PC build and Setup">

                <p>
                    Building and fixing computers started as a hobby and became
                    a way to learn real technical skills. I enjoy picking parts,
                    putting systems together, and solving performance problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interest supports my CIS studies and future work in IT.
                    It keeps me comfortable working inside machines and taking
                    responsibility for the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to keep building and upgrading systems and to stay
                    current with hardware changes over time.
