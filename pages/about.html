                <h2>My story</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Calgary, Alberta and have stayed here for school and work.
                    Technology first caught my attention through gaming, then through
                    building and upgrading computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time I moved from just using computers to wanting to understand
                    how they work and how to fix them. That interest led me to the
                    Computer Information Systems program at Mount Royal University.

                <h3>How I work</h3>
                <p>
                    I like clear steps, hands-on work, and direct feedback.
                    I enjoy breaking a problem into smaller pieces and testing
                    different solutions until it works.

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>What I value</h3>
                <p>
                    Reliability, effort, and communication matter to me. I try to
                    show up prepared, finish what I start, and own my mistakes
                    both in work and on the field.

                <h3>Short-term goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Build stronger foundations in programming, web development,
                    and IT support. Gain part-time or internship experience in a
                    technical role while I study.

                <h3>Long-term goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Work in a role where I support users, solve technical issues,
                    and keep learning. I would also like to stay connected to cars
                    and soccer in some way if I can.
