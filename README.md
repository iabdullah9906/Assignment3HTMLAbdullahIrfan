1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is my individual ePortfolio site for COMP 2511. The goal is to build a six-page website that is professional, responsive, accessible, and written with semantic HTML and external CSS. I really enjoyed creating this ePortfolio , as I got to display lots of things that I love to do. And the site showcases my background, resume, contact form, four artefacts (including this ePortfolio), and some of my personal interests such as soccer, PC building, and BMW diagnostics.

3. DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGIES

- HTML5 with semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, article, figure, footer, fieldset, legend).
- External CSS only; no inline styles.
- Layout built with CSS Flexbox and Grid.
- Responsive design with multiple breakpoints (e.g., around 900px and 520px) so layouts adapt for large, medium, and small screens.
- Consistent, professional dark theme with card-style sections and a strong hero layout on the home page.
- Shared header and footer across all pages for consistency and easy navigation.

4. ACCESSIBILITY

- Skip link to jump directly to the main content on every page.
- Clear heading structure with one main heading per page and logical levels beneath it.
- Descriptive alt text for all meaningful images.
- Contact form uses labels, fieldset and legend for grouped controls, and visible focus styles.
- Colours chosen to maintain good contrast between text and background.
- Introductory video includes a full text transcript on the home page.

5. References

I used GenAI (2025) to help polish some of the writing for my artefact descriptions and page content. The main prompt I used was:

"Double check the grammar on my writing and make it sound better."

All stories, technical details, and reflections are based on my real experiences. I reviewed and edited the AI-suggested text to make sure everything is accurate and represents my own work.

7. DESIGN INSPIRATION / REFERENCES

I reviewed the following Figma community template for brief visual inspiration on layout and styling:

- Personal portfolio template:
  https://www.figma.com/community/file/1116316830579955404/personal-portfolio-template

I only used this template for general ideas about spacing and layout. All HTML and CSS in this project were written by me specifically for this assignment.

All photos used in this site are my own personal images.
